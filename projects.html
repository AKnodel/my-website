                    <h3>Iris Flower Classification</h3>
                    <span class="timestamp">3 August, 2023</span>
                </div>
                <p>This project employs a TensorFlow neural network to classify Iris flowers by species using petal and
                    sepal measurements. Python libraries like matplotlib, scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas aid in
                    visualization and data manipulation. The Jupyter Notebook 'ml_model.ipynb' outlines the process,
                    from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. A 'data' folder contains the
                    dataset ('IRIS.csv') and a visualization ('output.png'). The project showcases TensorFlow,
                    scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook skills for flower classification.

                    <span class="timestamp">3 August, 2023</span>
                </div>
                <p>This project involves creating a machine learning model using linear regression to predict house
                    prices. Techniques such as scikit-learn, Lasso, L2 regularization, feature engineering, and one-hot
                    encoding are utilized for accuracy. The Jupyter notebook provides step-by-step instructions and code
                    implementation. The 'Housing.csv' dataset is used, and matplotlib is employed for data
                    visualization. Contributions are welcome, and acknowledgments are given to scikit-learn, 'kaggle,'
                    and the open-source community.</p>

                    <span class="timestamp">25 June, 2023</span>
                </div>
                <p>This Python checkers game includes an AI opponent utilizing the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta
                    pruning. Users can pick difficulty levels, themes, and play against human or AI. Implemented using
                    'main.py' or 'Ultimate_Checkers.exe', the AI opponent's depth is based on chosen difficulty.
                    Inspired by Tech With Tim's Checkers AI project.</p>

                        Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                    <span class="timestamp">1 August, 2023</span>
                </div>
                <p> In this course, I learned about unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and anomaly
                    detection, which can help discover patterns and outliers in data without labels. I also learned how
                    to build recommender systems that can suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences and
                    behavior, using both collaborative filtering and content-based deep learning methods. Finally, I
                    learned how to create a deep reinforcement learning model that can learn from its own actions and
                    rewards, and apply it to a game environment. I used Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenAI Gym for
                    this course.</p>

                </div>
                <p> In this course, I learned how to build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform
                    multi-class classification, apply best practices for machine learning development, and improve my
                    training data. We also learned about advanced topics such as convolutional neural networks,
                    recurrent neural networks, and natural language processing. We used Python and TensorFlow as
                    the main technologies for this course.</p>

                </div>
                <p>In this course, I learned how to build and train supervised machine learning models in Python using
                    popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn. I applied these skills to perform
                    prediction and binary classification tasks, such as linear regression and logistic regression, on
                    various datasets. I also learned how to measure error and select the best regression model for my
                    data.</p>
